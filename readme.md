# Description 📝
This project contains of an app for cat identification. Whole identification process is based on two convolution neural networks models: first is detecting cat noses and cut its image, then the nose image is pushed to another model, that makes indentification.
I was the neural network models developer so for now there is no server or app GUI, it was my coleague part.
# Outcomes for now 🔎
The identification models are teached on our 4 cats. The results were XXXX
# Future updates 🚀
The main update will be to create an Android GUI that will provide functionality to reteach the indentification model to indentify user cat (In progress)
